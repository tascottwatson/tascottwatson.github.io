<h3 style = "color:black"> 10. Lamarcus aldridge </h3>
<img src="lamarcus.jpg" alt="Lamarcus" style="position: absolute top: 470px; left: 30px; "></a>


<b><p style="position: relative"> Key Decade Stats: 20.9 ppg, 8.7 rpg, 2.1 apg, 1.2 bpg, 50%FG </p>
<p> Key Decade Achievements: 7 All-Stars, 5 All-NBA </p>
<p> Teams he Played for (Decade): Portland Trail Blazers, San Antonio Spurs </p>

<p> From the Key Decade Stats, we can see there is one Important Stat line missing, 3P%. This is because throughout the Early part of the Decade Lamarcus was averaging only around 0 - 0.1 3 pointers made a game.
 In the 2012-2013 season he averaged only 14% from downtown. Whilst in the later seasons of the Decade he has begun to pick up his three point shooting percentages, due to trends in the NBA,
 at 35% in the 2019-2020 season so far, he only attempts 1.8 a game, this is significantly lower than many superstar big men today such as Embiid or Davis. Despite this lack of three point shooting
 throughout the decade, Lamarcus Aldridge has been a very important player for both the Trail Blazers and the Spurs. As shown by his stats he can efficiently go out an get 20 in his prime.
 Whilst toward the later half of the Decade, he is slowly starting to regress, Lamarcus Alridge's eFG% has gone up every season for the last three seasons, currently sitting at 53% this season.
 Whilst Lamarcus has been a reliable player averaging around 20 ppg ,for this decade, his lack of shooting in the early parts of the decade, his what I believe to be inadequate rebounding for a 6-11
 Center/Power Forward, in comparison to other star Big Men such as Giannis, Davis, Embiid, Howard stop him from ranking higher on this all-decade list. He was also not a particulary good leader of the
 Portland Trail Blazers Team who only made it past the first round once with him as their star player. However his excellent defense, mid-range shot, and his ability to create offense for his team and
 his pretty good post game, all help him to get number 10 on the ALL-Decade List.</b>

<h3> 9.Paul George</h3>
<img src="pg.jpg" alt="Paul George" style="position: absolute top: 470px; left: 30px;" width ="252" height = "158"></a>
<b><p style = "position:relative"> Key Decade Stats: 20 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 3 apg, 1.6 spg, 43 FG%, 39 3P%</p>
<p> Key Decade Achievements: 6 All-Stars, 9 All-NBA, Most Improved Player (2012-2013)</p>
<p> Teams he played for (Decade): Indiana Pacers, Oklahoma City Thunder, Los Angeles Clippeps </p>

<p> Paul George is one of the best comebacks stories in the NBA. In the Summer before the 2014-2015 season, Paul George suffered a serious leg injury in a scrimmage in Las Vegas. In the 2014-2015 season,
PG-13 played a total of 6 Games, averaging only 8.8 ppg on 37% from the field. Before and (for two years after) the Injury, PG played for the Indiana Pacers. The Pacers had loads of Playoff success because
of Paul George and the surrounding cast. PG was able to book an Eastern Conference Finals with the Miami Heat Superteam two years in a row. Whilst PG's Pacers could never get over the Hump, they were still
able to take Lebron's Heat to 7 Games in one year and 6 Games in the other year. Since the two back to back ECF appearances, PG's teams (Pacers and Thunder) have struggled to get past the first round, however
this has not always been his fault. It is fair to say that Paul George has had relative Playoff success, more than most ranked under him. PG also has a wide range of skills, and very few things he cannot do.
Paul George is one of the best 3&D players we have ever had in the league. His ability to knock down shots, as well as defend others is something every team needs. We can see his abilities have been regonised
over the decade with 6 All-Star Selections, and 9 All-NBA Selections, alongside the 2012-2013 Most Improved Player. There are very few 6-8 Players who can knock down the three as well as PG-13. However despite
his immense skill he still does have flaws. Despite dubbing himself "Playoff P" and his mostly successfull playoff history, Paul George has been known to have some very bad games over the years, which could have
turned the series in favor of the opposition. Game 2 and 3 of the 2014 ECF Final vs the Heat are a great example of this. They lost both games, in part due to PG's poor shooting from the field. If PG had stepped
up in these two games the Pacers may have been able to move past the Heat into the NBA Finals. </b>

<h3> 8. Anthony Davis </h3>

<img src="ad.jpg" alt="Davis" style="position: absolute top: 470px; left: 30px; "></a>
<b><p style="position: relative"> Key Decade Stats: 24 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 2.3 apg, 1.4 spg , 2.3 bpg, 52%FG </p>
<p> Key Decade Achievements: 6 All-Stars, 6 All-NBA </p>
<p> Teams he Played for (Decade): New Orleans Pelicans, Los Angeles Lakers </p>

<p> Anthony Davis moving team has been one of the most talked about trade rumours in recent years before his eventual trade to Los Angeles this summer. Anthony Davis is a classic example of someone with loads of talent,
but a less-talented front office. Throughout this decade, the New Orleans Pelicans, with Anthony Davis leading them, has been unable to make much noise in the playoffs, if they even reach them at all. Throughout Davis' 7
seaons with the New Orleans Pelicans (first season under the name of New Orleans Hornets), they failed to make the playoffs five times, got knocked out the first round once,and only once got to the second round (in spectacular
fashion beating the one seeded Portland Trail Blazers in the First Round as the eight seed.). Whilst Anthony Davis did not always have the best teamates, I would expect having Jrue Holiday, Julius Randle, Demarcus Cousins,
Eric Gordon, Tyreke Evans over the years would have led to more playoff appearances, questioning Anthony Davis' ability to lead a team. However despite his questionable leadership abiity and lack of much playoff success, Anthony
Davis is an exceptional talent in the league. He was nominated for Defensive Player of the Year in 2018 showing his excellent ability on the defensive end of the floor. Whilst he is one of the best defensive player of this
decade, it could be argued his Offensive game is just as good. He averaged 28 ppg in two consecutive years, and continues to be a constant double-double threat every single night. The one part of his offensive game that could
use a little bit of work is his shooting and more specifically his three point shooting. He started his career attempting about 0.1 a game. In his fourth season however he started to pick up his three point shooting, attempting
two a game. Ever since that season he attempts around 2-3 a game, however he has not been a very efficient three point shooter over the years at an average of around, 23.5 % 3PFG

<h3>7. Russel Westbrook </h3>

<img src="westbrook.jpg" alt="Westbrook" style="position: absolute top: 470px; left: 30px; "></a>
<b><p style="position: relative"> Key Decade Stats: 24.4 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 8.5 apg, 1.8 spg, 43.7%FG </p>
<p> Key Decade Achievements: 8 All-Stars, 8 All-NBA, Most Valuable Player (2016-2017) </p>
<p> Teams he Played for (Decade): Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets </p>

<p> Westbrook is one of the best all round Offensive players of the Decade as shown by his ability to be a nightly triple-double threat and his three consecutive seasons averaging a triple double. Those three seasons have been enough to
	boost Westbrook up to number 2 on the all time triple double leaderboard at 144. He also became the second person in NBA history to average a triple double, after the great Oscar Robertson. If that is not impressive enough, Westbrook
	is the only player to average a triple double for three consecutive seasons or just three seasons at all. His ability to get steals, playmake, score and rebound despite being only 6-3, earned him the 2016-2017 Most Valuable Player.
	Despite these record breaking accomplishments, there are many things that hold him back from being higher on this list. As you can tell from his Stats he is the most inefficient player on this list, at 43.7% FG aside from PG-13
	(although George's effiency is distorted due to his injured season). His three point shooting efficieny isn't much better sitting at around 27% 3P, and whilst at the start of the decade he was averaging around 30-34% 3P, toward the end
	of the decade he is averaging around 23-29%3P which for a point guard is well below average. If his shooting continues to decline it may be more beneficial for him to stop shooting them all together. Another problem with Russell Westbrook
	is his lack of playoff sucess in the past three years. Whilst at the start of the Decade, the OKC Thunder made a finals appearance, two WCF appearances, a second round or two and missed the playoffs completley due to Durant only playing 27
	games, in the past three years with teamates like Paul George, Steven Adams, Andre Roberson (when he is healthy), Victor Oladipo etc. the OKC Thunder has failed to get it pass the first round. Whilst this may not always be his fault, the
	popular opinion (with non-OKC fans) is that Westbrook is responsible for this lack of playoff success. Despite his recent troubles with winning in the Playoffs and his Inefficiency, Westbrook has been one of the best players on the
	offensive end with his spectacular playmaking and his ability to score, earning him the Number 7 spot on the list.
